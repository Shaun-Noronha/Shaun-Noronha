ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Shaun Francis Noronha, a graduate student pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. My passion lies in software development, data science, and web development. Currently seeking Summer 2024 internship opportunities, I bring a diverse skill set and a drive to leverage technology for solving real-world challenges.

ðŸŽ“ With a solid foundation in computer engineering from Xavier Institute of Engineering, Mumbai, I've honed my skills in Python, Java, C++, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. My coursework and professional experiences have equipped me to tackle complex problems and deliver innovative solutions.

ðŸ’¼ As a Software Development Intern at CMP Infotech, I streamlined Pathology Lab operations with Python automation and developed a WhatsApp chatbot for patient communication. At Brainovision Pvt. Ltd, I led the development of an e-commerce website and implemented workflow automation tools.

ðŸš€ In my projects, I've led the development of a Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval tool and explored audio adversarial attacks on deep learning models, showcasing my creativity and problem-solving skills.

ðŸŒŸ Outside of academics and work, I've held leadership roles as the Marketing Head for the University Cultural Fest and as the Organization Head for IEEE Organization XIE, enhancing my communication, teamwork, and project management skills.

ðŸ“« Interested in discussing potential opportunities? Let's connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaunnoronha7) or shoot me an email at sfnoronha@wpi.edu. Looking forward to chatting!
